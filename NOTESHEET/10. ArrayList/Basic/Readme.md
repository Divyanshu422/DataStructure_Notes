## Sheet 1:

    - Defining the syntax of arrayList
                * add method(E object)
                * get method(index)
                * remove method
                * set method => add particular index
                * contains method
                * size method -> similary to the length property in array

## Sheet 2:

    - Reversing the arraylist
    - Usage: size() method

## Sheet 3:

    - Understanding the add method
    - why adding the element at an index which is not present in the arrayList size => will give error. even when the arrayList is dynamic in nature.

## Sheet 6:

    - Sorting the ArrayList using the Collections class in which we have sort method

## Sheet 7 and 8:

    - 2D arrayList

## Sheet 9:
