# Stack => LIFO
- Stack has only end called top where insertion, deletion and modification happens. there are 3 operation in the stack
- push operation:   
- Pop Operation
- Peek Operation


time complexity of achieving the stack operation => `O(1)`. 

# Implemented Using the 3 Data Structure:
-  `Array:` add the element on the index and shift the top to next index
- ArrayList: 
- `Linked List:` In Linked List elements are always added and removed wrt the head. hence the top in stack is head of LL
